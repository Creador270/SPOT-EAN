    "### spot_sm.cpp\n",
    "\n",
    "This C++ program is a ROS (Robot Operating System) node for controlling a robot named `spot_mini`. Here's a breakdown of what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Global Variables**: It declares some global variables to keep track of the robot's state and some flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Callback Functions**: It defines several callback functions that are triggered when certain events occur:\n",
    "   - `teleop_callback`: This function is called when a `geometry_msgs::Twist` message is received on the \"teleop\" topic. It updates the robot's command based on the received message.\n",
    "   - `estop_callback`: This function is called when a `std_msgs::Bool` message is received on the \"estop\" topic. If the message data is true, it stops the robot and sets the `ESTOP` flag.\n",
    "   - `swm_callback`: This function is a service callback that switches the robot's movement mode when the \"switch_movement\" service is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Function**: The main function does the following:\n",
    "   - Initializes the ROS node and sets up the subscribers, publisher, and service.\n",
    "   - Initializes a message of type `mini_ros::MiniCmd` to be published.\n",
    "   - Enters a loop where it does the following:\n",
    "     - Calls `ros::spinOnce()` to process incoming messages and call the appropriate callbacks.\n",
    "     - Gets the current command from the robot.\n",
    "     - If certain conditions are met, it updates the `mini_cmd` message with the current command.\n",
    "     - If a timeout occurs, it logs an error message.\n",
    "     - Publishes the `mini_cmd` message on the \"mini_cmd\" topic.\n",
    "     - Resets the `motion_flag` and sleeps for the remainder of the loop period to maintain the desired frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this node is responsible for controlling the `spot_mini` robot based on the commands received on the \"teleop\" topic and the \"estop\" topic, and it can switch the robot's movement mode when the \"switch_movement\" service is called. It publishes the robot's command on the \"mini_cmd\" topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### teleop_node.cpp\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is a ROS (Robot Operating System) node for teleoperating a robot named `spot_mini`. Here's a breakdown of what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: It initializes the ROS node and sets up the publishers, subscriber, and service client. It also retrieves several parameters from the ROS parameter server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Teleop Object**: It creates a `Teleop` object, which is presumably a class that handles the processing of joystick inputs to generate commands for the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Loop**: The main loop does the following:\n",
    "   - Calls `ros::spinOnce()` to process incoming messages and call the appropriate callbacks.\n",
    "   - Checks the state of the emergency stop (E-STOP) and the trigger from the `Teleop` object.\n",
    "   - If the E-STOP is active and a certain time has passed (debouncing), it logs a message that the E-STOP command is being sent.\n",
    "   - If the trigger is not active, it publishes a `geometry_msgs::Twist` message on the \"teleop\" topic with the current command from the `Teleop` object, and resets the E-STOP.\n",
    "   - If the trigger is active and a certain time has passed (debouncing), it calls the \"switch_movement\" service to switch the robot's movement mode, and resets the E-STOP.\n",
    "   - Publishes a `mini_ros::JoyButtons` message on the \"joybuttons\" topic with the current button states from the `Teleop` object.\n",
    "   - Publishes a `std_msgs::Bool` message on the \"estop\" topic with the current E-STOP state.\n",
    "   - Sleeps for the remainder of the loop period to maintain the desired frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this node is responsible for processing joystick inputs to control the `spot_mini` robot. It publishes the robot's command on the \"teleop\" topic, the joystick button states on the \"joybuttons\" topic, and the E-STOP state on the \"estop\" topic. It can also switch the robot's movement mode by calling the \"switch_movement\" service."
